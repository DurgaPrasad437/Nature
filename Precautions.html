    <p>The menace of pollution is rising day by day and is affecting humans in many ways. We cannot go back and cure for the things that we have done wrong but of course, we can take steps to make things better and to further prevent the degradation of our environment.</p>
     <p> This is a cause about which every country of this world is concerned and is also affecting them all. Environmental pollution is an exceptionally major global concern because of the harmful effects of pollution on the human health as well as the environment. Environmental pollution comes in various forms, such as air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, etc. making arrangements for preventing the onset of pollution in any area, i.e. be it on air, water or land can be the starting step and the simplest preventive solution to this huge problem. This may need a sincere effort to adopt good practices or habits by the people and the proper implementation of appropriate government laws and the strict compliance with these regulations, especially by potential industrial pollutants.</p>
